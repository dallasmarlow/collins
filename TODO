There's a minor regression that has to do with the findOrCreate method in
asset meta that needs to be fixed.

Need to refactor the ruby client before we opensource

Need to refactor controllers: AssetWebApi, IpAddressApi, IpmiApi, TagApi

Need to update docs with info about virtual server nodes and make required contact length configurable
